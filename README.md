# Real-Time-Model-Inference

Through an intensive workshop, I successfully developed and deployed a web application utilizing Snowpark for Python and scikit-learn. The project focused on training a Linear Regression model to predict future Return On Investment (ROI) for various advertising spend budgets across search, video, social media, and email channels. Notable tasks accomplished include:  Configuring a preferred IDE (e.g., Jupyter, VSCode) for Snowpark and Machine Learning (ML) Conducting comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and performing data engineering tasks using Snowpark DataFrames Leveraging curated Snowflake Anaconda channel to seamlessly integrate open-source Python libraries with minimal overhead Deploying ML model training code on Snowflake using Python Stored Procedure Designing and registering Scalar and Vectorized Python User-Defined Functions (UDFs) to facilitate inference Establishing a Snowflake Task for automated model (re)training Developing a Streamlit web application that utilizes the Scalar UDF for real-time inference on new data points based on user input This experience showcases my proficiency in data analysis, ML model training, web application development, and integration with cloud-based platforms like Snowflake.
